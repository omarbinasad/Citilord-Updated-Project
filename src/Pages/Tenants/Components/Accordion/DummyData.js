      Properties are offered either furnished or unfurnished but all will have
      at least carpeting and curtains. The degree to which properties are
      furnished varies, and prospective tenants are encouraged to discuss
      whether they are seeking a fully furnished or unfurnished property. In
      certain instances, landlords may provide additional items of furniture or
      appliances.

      <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Inventory</span>
      <br />
      An inventory will be prepared, detailing the fixtures and fittings in the
      property together with their condition. You will be required to sign a
      schedule of condition confirming you agree with the inventory. The
      inventory will be used when you leave the property to assess any damage or
      dilapidation to the property. With allowances made for fair wear and tear,
      any damage noted or cleaning required will be charged to an outgoing
      tenant. It is strongly advised that you check the inventory carefully to
      ensure you are in agreement with it. Upon receipt of the inventory, you
      will be given 48 hours to make any further comments. If we do not hear
      from you within this time, it will be assumed you are in agreement with
      the inventory.

      council tax, telephone charges, TV licence and a tenant’s personal
      contents insurance (unless otherwise stated) and tenants will be
      responsible for their payment. Where Citi Lord Ltd manages a property, we
      will advise the various suppliers of your occupancy. However, tenants must
      contact suppliers to set up an account and contact the local council with
      regards to council tax.

      for an additional security deposit to be held. Carpets must be
      professionally cleaned, sanitized, deodorized and
      anti-bacteria/flea-treated on vacating the property. The original invoice
      for the cleaning must be supplied to confirm this has been done. If
      evidence is not supplied, Citi Lord Ltd or the landlord will arrange for
      this to be carried out and the cost deducted from a deposit.

      Tenants will be informed at the start of a tenancy who is managing the
      property and given contact details. Many landlords have service contracts
      and preferred contractors, so if the landlord is managing the property,
      any maintenance issues must be reported directly to them. Failure to do so
      may mean you are liable for any deterioration or damage resulting from
      delay. You must not instruct a contractor to undertake any work as if you
      do it will be at your own expense. If Citi Lord Ltd is managing the
      property, any maintenance issues must be reported to us directly. We will
      endeavour to address maintenance issues as soon as possible and emergency
      repairs will be addressed within 24 hours. We always request our
      contractors contact you directly to obtain access to the property. If you

      The following regulations must be adhered to without failure by the
      Landlord and as Agents we must ensure that they are carried out. Gas
      Safety (Installations and Use) Regulations 1994 (1996) A qualified
      Engineer (CORGI or British Gas) must check all gas appliances and fitted
      installations annually. This includes such items as Gas Fires, Central
      Heating boilers, Gas cookers and other gas appliances. It also insists
      that flues and chimneys are clear of obstructions and in the correct
      place. A Gas Safety Record (GSR) must be kept with the dates of inspection
      and any defects identified. This record must be provided to the tenant
      upon signing the tenancy agreement. A gas appliance with an open flue
      should not be installed in a bedroom. Where the gas meter is installed in
      a meter box, you should supply the tenant with a suitably labeled key to
      the box. After work on any gas appliance, a defined series of safety
      checks must be performed. Instructions for any gas appliance must be left
      for the tenant. Any gas appliance that is suspected or known to be faulty
      or incorrectly installed must not be used by anyone and should be
      removed/replaced or repaired immediately. Ventilation is needed for gas
      appliances to work correctly and safely. You should take care not to block
      vents and air bricks. Any items that fail to comply with the regulations
      must be fixed or removed immediately.

      Ventilation is needed for gas appliances to work correctly and safely. You
      should take care not to block vents and air bricks. Any items that fail to
      comply with the regulations must be fixed or removed immediately. The
      Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 1994 these regulations require
      that all Electrical equipment left at the property be “safe and of no risk
      or injury to human or animal?. They should check that flexes, fuses and
      electrical output are safe and correct. Items that must comply are all
      portable electrical items such as electric cooker, fridge’s, washing
      machines, kettles, toasters etc. From 1st January 2005, all domestic
      electric installation work (particularly in kitchens and bathrooms) must
      be carried out by a Government “Approved? contractor. In addition,
      electrical contractors will have to verify that the work complies with
      British Standard Safety Requirements (BS7671). Failure to comply with
      these regulations is a criminal offence and could result in fines of up to
      £5,000 and/or imprisonment.
      <br />
      <br />
      Citi Lord Real Estate we cannot certify which items are safe or not and
      will recommend that a qualified electrician checks these items (a charge
      will be made). This can be carried out by your own electrician. Only use
      “Competent Approved? contractors. Ensure that cracked/damaged sockets or
      plugs and frayed wiring is made good (1994 Plugs and Sockets Act). Ensure
      all appliances are safe to use prior to any let – i.e.
      cooker/kettle/toaster etc. Property should be inspected and tested at
      least every 10 years by a “Competent Person? (Electrical Equipment
      (Safety) Regulations 1994) All socket outlets which may be used for
      equipment outdoors (e.g. a lawnmower) should be protected by a Residual

      (Safety) Regulations 1988 (1993) - All soft furnishings such as settees,
      sofas, beds, padded chairs, pillows cushions and must comply with the Fire
      Resistance requirements contained within the regulations. Items of
      furniture made prior to 1950 are termed as antiques and as such are
      excluded from the regulations.
      <br />
      <br />
      These regulations were amended in 1993 and it is now an offence to install
      any furniture in let properties which does not comply with the
      regulations. The regulations apply to beds, mattresses and headboards,
      scatter cushions and pillows, stretch or loose covers for furniture,
      children’s furniture, garden furniture and any items of similar type
      fillings which must carry the appropriate labels of compliance.
      Upholstered furniture must have fire resistant filling material and must
      pass a cigarette resistance test. Permanent covers must pass a match
      resistance test. Usually a label is attached to the item of furniture to
      confirm it is acceptable. The regulations do not apply to Antique
      furniture or any made before 1st January 1950. Bedclothes (including
      duvets and pillowcases) Loose covers for mattresses, curtains Carpets,
      sleeping bags, cushion covers. Whilst only properties built after 1992
      legally require the fitting of smoke detectors (Building Regulation 1991),
      we would strongly recommend that smoke detectors are fitted to each floor
      of the property being let. The penalty for failure to comply with
      statutory safety legislation is currently a maximum of £5,000 and/or 6
      months imprisonment for each offence. This can be harsher in the case of
      injury or fatality. The above is only a guide to the legal safety
      requirements and should you have any further enquiries, we would recommend
      that you contact a qualified solicitor who will be able to verify these in
      full.

      NOTE – Tenants are reminded that the costs for any repairs they commission
